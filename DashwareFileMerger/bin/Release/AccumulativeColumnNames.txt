// Note that on each file split, you'll lose one line worth of incremental value since each file starts at zero.
// There's no way to guess what incremental value should have accumulated since the previous file, unlike time columns 
// where the value to increment (instead of adding zero) is known (or at least calculable, assuming there's no jitter).
